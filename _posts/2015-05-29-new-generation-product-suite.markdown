Upcoming is the days of seamless integrated sub-micro applications.  I have a vision of developing many application they talk together.  The ecommerce that I am going to talk about is a combination of many applications, to name a few:

1.  A portal front-end which is java-script and static page driven application
2.  A content service for assest management
3.  A Business control center to connect to the content service
4.  An orchestrator which controls the publishing work flow
5.  A cart back-end application
6.  An erp for inventory and order management
7.  A CRM for customer relationship and identity management
8.  A geo location and map integration system
9.  A logistics and vehicle travel and distribution system
10. Product management system with hierarchical catelog system
11. Humar resource management system with payment and taxes
12. Billing and accounting system
13. Data migration, back-up and maintenance system


A many of them will have to have hosted for multi-client mode so that, they work in the clould.  To deliver a holistic experience to the cloud user all these applications has to be built and communicate seamlessly.

The first step towards this direction is to build a portal solution which is java-script and widget driven.

The second step will be to have Catalog system and Cart etc.
