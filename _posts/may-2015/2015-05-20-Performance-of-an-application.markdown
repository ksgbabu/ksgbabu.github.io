It has been mentioned that performance is a post development task.  I have read this statement in different places.  Does that mean we will have to have a seperate session for performance assessment before release.  But that had been done very rarely and always hear from the customer that when they access the server it is not performing as expected.

Infrastructure team is not really considering the best of the turning for the application.  Rather they try to understand how do even asses the performance than tuning.
