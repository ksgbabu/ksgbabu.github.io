I knew the concept of class loaders and its hierarchies.  But was not very sure about the difference between the classloader difference when it is related to ThreadContext.  I got a read today, it says, that is something related the Thread which the class is being executed. At the momement what I understood is that will have more visibility to the other class than the class level class loader has.
