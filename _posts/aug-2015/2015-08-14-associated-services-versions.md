We were thinking providing version check to our major service and then the sibling service validate that version so that we ensure the service level call compatibility.  We proposed sending the versions with every call?  However one colleage was opposed to it and he think that is an added complexity.

What do we mean by complexity?

In my perspective complexity is the factor that make additional work in future.  Does this decision of version compatibility check becomes an additional complexity? If we take up that work is that good for the future?  What is the rational behind to reject it?
