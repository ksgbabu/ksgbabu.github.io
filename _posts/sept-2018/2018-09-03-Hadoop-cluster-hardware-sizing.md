title: Hadoop cluster hardware selection.
---

I had a team unfortunately was not in my control and they did a lot of mistakes in prodcution configuration
is concerned.  They had no any idea how the hardware sizing can be done and did as they liked. The
result was bad customer remarks and thus we killed ourselves.

I was pushed aside and did not involved me and I could not really question them as they were pet of
one of my partner itself.  He gave them ultimate freedom and even the team or my partner did
not like when I questioned them.  It was quite unfortunate that I had bet my 30 lakhs on that
team and eventually our relationship got worsened.

It was quite clear that I was in dilemma.  Possibly the team might have done right.  But the issue
is that they did not involve their sponsor as I had bet my 15 Lakhs and my friend 15 lakhs on this
team and my partner has even had taken nearly a crore rupee on them.  May be that made the team
thnking they are super in charge and no need to talk to the owner.

This time I was very cautious in selecting the team.  I gave them opportunity to experiment and I
read many articles and selected a low configuration as possible.

However my musing on selecting the hardware is put here.  Selecting the hardware that best balance of performance
and economy for a given workload requires testing and validation.  I would like to jot down some of the principles
that I followed here.  Also major criterias that we need to keep in mind during this process.
