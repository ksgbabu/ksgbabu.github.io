This is more to make my developement skill more professional than to learn jekyll.  But that was very tough.  Any time when we get into something new and learn with out a documentation is very tough.  Even if there are good documentation around we get in to a slot of spending enormous amount of time to learn it.  Who care whether that is a hard earned learnings!

I think this is a beginning to work as a professional.  Every day we learn thousands of things and get a new way to publish that to the out side worlds with some good formatting and easy to create blogs.

I should for get the old way of pasting and formatting the code.  now markdown approach--


    publiic static void main(String args[])
    {
	
	  System.out.println("hello world");
    }	



I understood that the vim is not a good way to type english.  It is for coders editor mostly.  That too is not working good when we cut and paste anything.  Did that behave like that to stop cut and paste coding.  Lol!  I can't say that.

I don't get how the posts can be formated with the layouts.  I tried a bit but the included pages are not really picked up!
