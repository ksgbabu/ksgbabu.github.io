Software Projects are journey to unknowns.  Some think they are an expedition.  When I look at my company
development process, the most difficult part is to get involved in development.  It is always hard to get
enough visibility in to development.  I don't get enough predictability most of the time.

Some others see organisations are like living systems.  We can never direct a living system, only disturb
it and wait to see the response... We can't know all the forces shaping an organisation we wish to change, 
so all we can do is provoke the system in some way by experimenting with a force we think might have some
impact, then watch to see what happens.

Getting used to emergent design is hard becuase it feels like you are going to be just hacking! And if 
you have prided yourself on being a very good developer and always doing well-thought-out designs, it 
turns your whole world upside down and says "no, all those things you thought made you great, now those
same things actually make you a bad developer."  Very world-rocking stuff.
