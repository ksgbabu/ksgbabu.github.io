There is no universally agreed upon measure of productivity.  Measuring productivity of developers is impo-
ssible.  Some teams use number of lines of code as a proxy for productivity.  Others use number of function
points delivered, or features (story points) delivered, ignoring that not all features are the same size.

But generally it is an accepted fact the Agile and Scrum increases the productivity compared to Waterfall
methods.  Also it shows that lower in cost.  Employees enjoy working on Agile projects are key.  

Surveys shows Agile projects are 37% more faster to market.  Quality is also will improve through many of
the engineering practices such as pair programming, refactoring, and a strong emphasis on early and automated
testing.
