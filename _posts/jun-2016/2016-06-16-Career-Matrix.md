Recently I had a sitting with our team to define Career Matrix.  Most of them are looking at that as a tool
for our developers to understand how they can improve on their skills.  They were thinking it to mention
a set of quality attributes for individual designations.  

In their version they said, one should look at what are the skills and roles that I should do in and
what are the other sets of skills or attributes that I have to learn to become to next level.

In fact I was trying to understand what is that different from designations to designations.  I believe that
the new generation companies in reality does not require designations at all.  Simply all are developers.
Why managers, architects, business analysts etc.  I don't see any value in those designated roles.  What is 
important is deliver the right quality code which every one can understand and contribute. 

I have trouble to understand why certain things are important.  Say a system can comprises of build tools but
spending and be over complicated build process is overkill. What we require is just a small and detached
service (may be microservice) and just build it a s a component so that other part of the system can commu-
nicate with that easily.

In my opinion there is no difference in skills to be learned in each level or each roles.  But as the 
experience increases their skills will also be matured.  I don't think we should restrict from a junior
on how to design.  It is a mandatory skills in all levels but it might not be well understood by a junior
but someone senior will have more understanding and varieties of that kind.  But why should we say a junior
learn designing and thus becomes senior developers.  I feel that ridiculous to think a junior can't design a
sysem.  Similary the interpersonal skills and communication skills are vital and minimal.  I don't really
think any organisation can tolerate anyone who does not have enough communication skills.  My believe is that
ability to communicate may not he restricted to a language or connected people.  But the communication is 
all about an urge to share the information and receive it.  I have seen certain seniors are bad in that than
Juniors!!

Why we need a Business analyst who only write stories?  Why do we want a test who always check the funcational
spec and do user experience tests.  I think that time has gone.  Now everything requires some amount of code
is to be written and execute it for highlignhting how interesting these are .
