I was really trying to explain how the integration tests can leverage the confidence in releases.  I am wondering why they can't understand the concept.  I sent the related anti-pattern and warned the organization should not fall into it.  

One of the architect suggest 100% UI tests.  It was a desperation for me.  I was trying to get the development standard upto the mark to have sufficient integration tests.  But it won't serve the purpose if developers itself write that.  It won't come to the level of required quality if any organization won't have dedicated team for writing integration tests.  I started doubting whether those participent really understand what kind of integrationt tests are we talking about!

I send the ice-cream-con anti pattern details to them.  None of them has responded to it.  Finally the decided to have another meeting.  How these kind of requirement be leveraged from business requirement.  I don't think that is the right approach.  It is the teachnical leadership experience will be important there!
